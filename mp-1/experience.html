    <h2>Customer Spending Analysis Based on Social and Location Data</h2>
    <p>This project aimed at providing better solutions for market marketing by combining research on social data, location data, and customer spending levels. My contributions included:
      (1) Data Collection and Organization: Responsible for collecting and organizing customers' social and location data, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
      (2) Model Development and Analysis: Utilized logistic regression models based on collected data to explore the impact of location and social media data on customer spending. Identified key factors and assessed their impact on spending through data analysis and statistical methods.
      (3) Customer Spending Prediction: Predicted customer spending in May 2020 using the developed model. Compared the impact of location data and social media data on spending.
      (4) Customer Behavior Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of behavior data and related data characteristics for 11 high-spending customers.</p>
    <h3>Outcome: The paper titled "The Study of Customers Consuming Behavior According to Social and Location Data" was accepted by The 4th International Conference on Big Data Research (ICBDR 2020).<h3>
